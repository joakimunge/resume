I was very impressed with his ability to solve problems and how fast he was able to apply techinques that he just learned. It was also very impressive to watch how quickly he grew into his role. He is an excellent self-starter that has good instincts and a knack for knowing exactly what is needed to achive the project goals. I learned a lot from working with Joakim and hope to work with him again some day. Looking back, I am very proud of the work we did together."

      "name": "William Sampson",
      "reference": "I worked with Joakim for several years and during that time always found him to be a creative, humble and dedicated colleague. He is keen to learn and keen to apply his knowledge in any environment, always rising to the challenge put before him. When asked to take on large scale projects–such as the production of a series of gameplay trailers–Joakim delivered without hesitation and with excellent execution, even if projects were outside of his immediate role. I would highly recommend Joakim for his positive character as a member of any creative team."

He is also a very nice person to work with, he has a very positive attitude, a great sense of humour and gets along well with anyone. If you're looking for a fun, creative and very versatile designer, you've found him."
